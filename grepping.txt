./venv_hailo_rpi5_examples/lib/python3.11/site-packages/opencv_python-4.10.0.84.dist-info/METADATA:93:    These packages are smaller than the two other packages above because they do not contain any GUI functionality (not compiled with Qt / other GUI components). This means that the packages avoid a heavy dependency chain to X11 libraries and you will have for example smaller Docker images as a result. You should always use these packages if you do not use `cv2.imshow` et al. or you are using some other package (such as PyQt) than OpenCV to create your GUI.
